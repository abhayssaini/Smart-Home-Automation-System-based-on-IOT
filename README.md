# Smart-Home-Automation-System-based-on-IOT

This project is based on Internet Of  Things (IOT) which will be beneficial for the people to automatically operate and manage home appliances like (fans, lights, etc) remotely with the help of web application (Web Page).

### Our purpose in this project is to automate fans depending on the data (presence of  a person and room temperature) received by the sensors for sustainable use of electricity. 


## Discussion on Hardware/ Software  tools:-

-  Hardware tools

      a. Passive infrared sensor (PIR): This sensor will detect the human presence in the room i.e. works when anybody leaves or enters the room.

      b. DHT11 (Temperature and  Humidity) Sensor: This sensors  will measure the temperature and  humidity  in real time and the data provided by the sensor will be helpful in the switching on and off the other devices (fan,etc).

     c. USB Fan: Fan used for cooling purpose.

- Software tools

   a. Raspbian: This is the official operating system for raspberry pi and we will be using this OS for interfacing between  different sensors with the Web page.

   b. Thonny Python IDE: used for the coding purpose and connecting the sensor outputs to the web page.

   c. HTML web page: To display the working condition of fan and to display temperature value.
